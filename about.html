        <div class="about-content">
          <p>I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at the University of Southern California, pursuing a combined <strong>BS/MS degree</strong> with an expected graduation in <strong>May 2027</strong>.</p>

          <p>Currently, I serve as the <strong>Electrical Systems Lead</strong> for <em>USC Formula Electric Racing</em>, where I oversee electrical systems integration and safety architecture for our competition vehicles. Previously, I co‑founded <em>Neoterium Labs</em>, an engineering maker space where I directed development of innovative projects—including a <a href="{{ '/projects/metal-detecting-rover.html' | relative_url }}" class="text-link">Metal‑Detecting Rover</a> and a Rubik's‑Cube‑Solving Robot.</p>

          <p>My technical interests span <strong>PCB design</strong>, <strong>embedded firmware</strong>, <strong>power electronics</strong>, and <strong>AI‑assisted hardware design</strong>. I'm passionate about transforming complex engineering challenges into practical, reliable solutions.</p>

          <p>Beyond the lab, I enjoy <em>snowboarding, skateboarding, running, hiking, and other adrenaline‑fuelled activities</em>. These adventures keep me balanced and inspire the creative thinking I bring to every project.</p>
