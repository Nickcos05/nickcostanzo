          <h2 class="section-title">Project Overview</h2>
          <p>The Speaker Driver Board is a specialized PCB designed to drive three piezo speakers on an electric racing vehicle. Its primary purpose is to serve as a safety system that alerts team members and bystanders when high voltage is active in the vehicle.</p>
          <p>This project was developed as part of my work with USC Formula Electric Racing, where safety is a critical concern when dealing with high-voltage systems in competitive electric vehicles.</p>
