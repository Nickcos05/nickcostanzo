          <p>The Shut-Down Relay Board is a critical safety component designed for the USC Formula Electric racing vehicle. This custom 4-relay PCB is responsible for isolating the high-voltage accumulator during fault conditions, ensuring the safety of both the vehicle and its operators. The system was developed to respond to multiple fault conditions including Brake System Plausibility, BMS (Battery Management System), IMD (Isolation Monitoring Device), and Inverter Precharge faults.</p>
          <p>As the lead designer and firmware developer, I was responsible for the complete development lifecycle, from initial design through testing and validation. The system leverages the STM32's capabilities for robust and reliable operation in the demanding environment of a Formula Electric vehicle.</p>
